# T9-Navillera
Navillera is an app connected with a LED Light system that will help stabilize and reflect mood. This is a project centered around Empathy. 
 
The idea is that the user will be able to open the app, select a mood they are feeling, and the lights will reflect or soothe the user’s mood.
 
Based on psychological research, an interior space can have a great impact on a student's mood and motivation. There have been many studies showing that warm colors are stimulating and cool colors can be calming. This is based on the amount of visual effort the brain has to go through to process these colors. Longer wavelengths, such as red, require the brain to process much more. Green has a wavelength that is easiest for the brain to process and therefore, tends to have calming effects. Using this knowledge, we have empathized with the student population and by utilizing aesthetics, we can further reach out with empathy. This prototype has the potential to have a wide range of accessibility due to cheap and easy to produce hardware. 
 
For example:
	The user is feeling stressed , they can select the “I am stressed” option on the app. The lights will turn to a color that has been researched, such as green, that has proven to be calm and stress soothing.
